<h1 align="left">Intro Paragraph</h1>
Despite concerns of an ongoing global pandemic, increase in international turmoil, and the uncertainty of the US economy, leisure traveling is expected to reach new highs (Mckinsey). As the interest in traveling increases, individuals are faced with the question of booking a hotel or renting an Airbnb. Despite where you may stand on this debate, it is hard to ignore the success Airbnb has had since the demise of traveling at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, Airbnb posted revenue of $1.5 billion in Q1 of 2022, and average daily rates continue to rise (CNN).

To match this demand in traveling, more & more hosts are buying out property for the sole purpose of short term rentals. New York City alone saw the number of available short term rentals increase to 13,000 (Bloomberg). Using data available from Inside Airbnb we will analyze New York Cityâ€™s Airbnb listings data to build a predictive model on future rental prices. The different regression models that will be used include linear, lasso, ridge, random forest and GBM. The analysis and model will be incorporated into a final dashboard that a host can use to learn about their desired market.
